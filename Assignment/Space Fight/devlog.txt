	- Primary design is to have the game generate an enemy plane every few seconds, and the player will fire to destroy that.
	- Aesthetic goals:
		- Sensation: Let the player able feel they are actually flying the plane and firing bullets. If the plane can be bent while moving would be a success. If the plane is just moving without any motion would be a failure.
		 - Challenge: Let the player feel challenged when they play the game, making the game that they cannot win easily. If the player faces some challenges, it would be a success. If the player can win easily, it would be a failure.
	- Core loop: The player will spend most of the time moving around and firing a bullet to destroy enemies that are generated every few seconds. I can easily accomplish the Challenge goal to speed up the generation of the enemy. I can also accomplish the Sensation goal by changing spite when moving left and right.
